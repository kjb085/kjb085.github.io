Post: Classes are really important part of Ruby coding. Classes allow you to create methods that can be called on a specific class. We can equate this to things in the real world. Let's say that you're a chef and you come up with a new type of dish, we'll call it YBUR. Now you YBUR has a set of ingredients that don't really change, but you can do a lot of different cooking based things to them. As such, you make a list of how to prepare the ingridents. Similarly in Ruby, we create classes and methods that apply to those classes. These methods won't work on any other objects except ones that are of an applicable class. Going beyond this, there's a really important concep called instances inside of clases. Instances are a form of variable, method, etc. that can be called on beyond the class or method that it's created in. To denote this for variables, we use the @ symbol. This allows us to use the variable stored here in a specific method, outside of that method. This functionality of Ruby gives is a large amount of flexbility and really gives the language a lot of dynamics.
