Post: Exploring my values is definitely an interesting topic. I think this is a particularly hard one to address as well due to self bias. I think most people belief they have the right set of values or that they're following one set of values, but if you examine their heart, their values are actually different from what they consciously believe. Of the things that I believe are my core values are knowledge, self-reliance, leadership, accountability, effectiveness, self-awareness, and family relationships. Personally, I believe that self-awareness is something that I value because it has a significant impact on every area of ones life. Also, people who lack this tend to have a negative light on them and their ignorance about who they really are is a general turn off. Also, simply having a solid grasp on your abilities and capabilities helps feed into a lot of the other values I listed, specifically accountability and effectiveness. 

I would love to say that I live up to all of the values that I listed, but I definitely don't. I certainly try to and below you will find a list of each of the values and my personal rating 1-5, 1 being disagree and 5 being agreed:

Knowledge: 5
Self-Reliance: 4
Leadership: 4
Accountability: 2
Effectiveness: 3
Self-Awareness: 5
Family Relationships: 5

The last topic that someone asked me advice one was a guys opinion regarding a relationship. I wish I could say this fit into my values in some way, shape, or form, but it does not. Moving forward, I personally like my set of values, but as I discussed earlier, I worry that the values that I listed have a self bias and they aren't truly the things that I value. Regardless, I don't really believe that anything other than self-awareness and leadership can help mediate stereotype threat and in that, it's more of a internal process than anything.
