Post: One of the biggest issues facing the tech industry is economic in nature. The issue is that a lot of the consumer spending on tehnology tends to be use of descretionary funds. Due to this, tech companies can take a significant impact when economies are tight. Specifically, before the great recession of 2008, the consumer savings rate was -1%. While clearly unsustainable, the consumer savings rate is now 4%. The change is understandable, but savings makes up a portion of descretionary income. As such, this indicated that people are spending less on technology than they were prior to 2008. The good news is that there are many tech companies, such as Google, who make their money in other ways, such as through ads. Personally, while I think ads are a good monetization method, I feel there is definitely a need for a change to profit from a high volume of users without imparing the experience by inindating them with ads. I don't know what the next best monetization method is, but I know I'll certainly be on the look out as well as thinking of different things to implement (and hopefully patent/license).
