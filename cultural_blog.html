				<h2>Feedback</h2>
				<h4>11/9/2014</h4>
				<p>So far at DBC, pairing has been the most interesting thing that is involved in the cirriculum. Pairing can be really awesome or pretty terrible, but this is all on you and your pair. Both are really responsible for 50% of what happens during the pairing session, so I definitely need to step back and examine what I could have done better during poor pairing sessions. The most rewarding thing is definitely finally seeing your code pass the rspec tests after struggling with your partner, especially after trying some new code which you're unsure will work. The most frustrating thing about challenges is often trying to adequately articulate my thought process. I've never been a very good teacher, but I'm constantly having to explain things that I'm just learning to others who have a similar level of understanding as well.</p>
				<p>After reviewing my feedback, I felt pretty good for the most part. While there were definitely some areas of improvement, pretty much all of the feedback was generally positive and others have enjoyed working with me and benefitted from me. There were a few from early on which I recognized some of my short comings and have already begun improving on. The biggest thing I need to work on is slowing it down a little bit. I can tend to work quickly and not always formulate my thoughts before saying something and this can negatively impact my pair. While this was something that I was somewhat aware of, it has been really great hearing others perspectives, although we would all like to have flawless feedback. Writing feedback was always interesting because sometimes when you're reflecting you notice things that during the pairing session you might not have identified as problems. More often then not, I've had some really good pairing sessions and writing actionable feedback is often the most difficult element of this for me.</p>

				<h2>Tech Industry Issue</h2>
				<h4>11/2/2014</h4>
				<p>One of the biggest issues facing the tech industry is economic in nature. The issue is that a lot of the consumer spending on tehnology tends to be use of descretionary funds. Due to this, tech companies can take a significant impact when economies are tight. Specifically, before the great recession of 2008, the consumer savings rate was -1%. While clearly unsustainable, the consumer savings rate is now 4%. The change is understandable, but savings makes up a portion of descretionary income. As such, this indicated that people are spending less on technology than they were prior to 2008. The good news is that there are many tech companies, such as Google, who make their money in other ways, such as through ads. Personally, while I think ads are a good monetization method, I feel there is definitely a need for a change to profit from a high volume of users without imparing the experience by inindating them with ads. I don't know what the next best monetization method is, but I know I'll certainly be on the look out as well as thinking of different things to implement (and hopefully patent/license).</p>

				<h2>Thinking Style</h2>
				<h4>10/26/2014</h4>
				<p>My learning style is concrete random. After doing some research and some self thought. After this, I've determined that working on challenges alone and being able to try and experiement with different things, specifically. Also diving into the material is almost always more beneficial than simiply learning the theory for me. Despite this, it's definitely still important for me to get the theory base, like reading the book. Finally, I need to be aware of this and possibly keep this to a minimum during pairing. My trial and error based approach often leads me to take over as a driver and get internally frustrated (slightly and I do a good job of expressing it in a conductive manner) when navigating because I want to see if something work or not.</p>
				<p>At this point in Phase 0, my biggest struggle as been with CSS on the conceptual level. This definitely is due to the way that I think. Ironically, this has beeb frustrating because it involves a lot of guess and check. Part of the frustration is that I learn through guess and check method, but there is a lot of doing it even after I've already learned and somewhat know what I'm doing in CSS. Also as noted another struggle has been with pairing, but I'm definitely aware of it and working on it.</p>
				<p>The biggest thing I need to change about the way that I learn is partially the aspect that drives me. Competition drives me to do better even if it is not explicit competition. I'm constantly guaging myself versus others and strive to do better. This is very indicative to a fixed mind set and includes risk aversion, at least on a public level. While I'm ok with failing in my own tickering by myself, I don't like to fail on a public stage and have the perception that I'm not intellegent. As you can clearly tell, this definitely needs to change.</p>
