				<h2>Thinking Style</h2>
				<h4>10/26/2014</h4>
				<p>My learning style is concrete random. After doing some research and some self thought. After this, I've determined that working on challenges alone and being able to try and experiement with different things, specifically. Also diving into the material is almost always more beneficial than simiply learning the theory for me. Despite this, it's definitely still important for me to get the theory base, like reading the book. Finally, I need to be aware of this and possibly keep this to a minimum during pairing. My trial and error based approach often leads me to take over as a driver and get internally frustrated (slightly and I do a good job of expressing it in a conductive manner) when navigating because I want to see if something work or not.</p>
				<p>At this point in Phase 0, my biggest struggle as been with CSS on the conceptual level. This definitely is due to the way that I think. Ironically, this has beeb frustrating because it involves a lot of guess and check. Part of the frustration is that I learn through guess and check method, but there is a lot of doing it even after I've already learned and somewhat know what I'm doing in CSS. Also as noted another struggle has been with pairing, but I'm definitely aware of it and working on it.</p>
				<p>The biggest thing I need to change about the way that I learn is partially the aspect that drives me. Competition drives me to do better even if it is not explicit competition. I'm constantly guaging myself versus others and strive to do better. This is very indicative to a fixed mind set and includes risk aversion, at least on a public level. While I'm ok with failing in my own tickering by myself, I don't like to fail on a public stage and have the perception that I'm not intellegent. As you can clearly tell, this definitely needs to change.</p>
