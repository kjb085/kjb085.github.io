				<h2>Values</h2>
				<h4>11/23/2014</h4>
				<p>Exploring my values is definitely an interesting topic. I think this is a particularly hard one to address as well due to self bias. I think most people belief they have the right set of values or that they're following one set of values, but if you examine their heart, their values are actually different from what they consciously believe. Of the things that I believe are my core values are knowledge, self-reliance, leadership, accountability, effectiveness, self-awareness, and family relationships. Personally, I believe that self-awareness is something that I value because it has a significant impact on every area of ones life. Also, people who lack this tend to have a negative light on them and their ignorance about who they really are is a general turn off. Also, simply having a solid grasp on your abilities and capabilities helps feed into a lot of the other values I listed, specifically accountability and effectiveness.</p>
				<p>I would love to say that I live up to all of the values that I listed, but I definitely don't. I certainly try to and below you will find a list of each of the values and my personal rating 1-5, 1 being disagree and 5 being agreed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Knowledge: 5</li>
					<li>Self-Reliance: 4</li>
					<li>Leadership: 4</li>
					<li>Accountability: 2</li>
					<li>Effectiveness: 3</li>
					<li>Self-Awareness: 5</li>
					<li>Family Relationships: 5</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The last topic that someone asked me advice one was a guys opinion regarding a relationship. I wish I could say this fit into my values in some way, shape, or form, but it does not. Moving forward, I personally like my set of values, but as I discussed earlier, I worry that the values that I listed have a self bias and they aren't truly the things that I value. Regardless, I don't really believe that anything other than self-awareness and leadership can help mediate stereotype threat and in that, it's more of a internal process than anything.</p>

				<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
				<h4>11/21/2014</h4>
				<p>This week the cultural topic that I explored is Stereotype Threat. To be honest, at first I did not know what this meant. The basic idea behind stereotype threat is that when there is a negative stereotype that someone is aware of, they are more likely to live down to the stereotype than those who are uneffected by said stereotype. While academics might initially spring to mind, studies have shown that there is no one set domain that can be impaired by stereotype threat. For example, white males have exhibited the conseqeuenes of streotype threat in athletic based situations because athleticism is often more associated with black males. While this is merely one example, this can impact anyone based on any stereotype that is given to any group, whether it is race, gender, sexual orientation or another category that one can fall into.</p>
				<p>Clearly, stereotype threat is a negative thing and it will be a long time before it can be completely eliminated (if this is at all possible, but that's more a question for psychologists and sociologists). Regardless, this should not deter us from trying to combat the effects. Ultimately, the change needs to occur in individuals in multiple respects. First, there needs to be the self acknowledgement that negative stereotypes are not blanket statements that are true for all people of a specific group. This then needs to manifest itself by ignoring those stereotypes that are applicable to you. From there, individuals need to be cognizant to not perpetuate negative stereotypes about others, whether this is done in jest or in a serious manner. While this is difficult to do, this change needs to be a global one to have a real impact. The other thing that individuals can do in order to help combat stereotype threat is to teach others about it as well. While the paradigm shift in your own mind is important, it's also important to help others get to that place as well. All in all, it is a daunting challenge to eliminate stereotype threat, but ultimately (prepare for the cliched ending), it starts with you.</p>

				<h2>Feedback</h2>
				<h4>11/9/2014</h4>
				<p>So far at DBC, pairing has been the most interesting thing that is involved in the cirriculum. Pairing can be really awesome or pretty terrible, but this is all on you and your pair. Both are really responsible for 50% of what happens during the pairing session, so I definitely need to step back and examine what I could have done better during poor pairing sessions. The most rewarding thing is definitely finally seeing your code pass the rspec tests after struggling with your partner, especially after trying some new code which you're unsure will work. The most frustrating thing about challenges is often trying to adequately articulate my thought process. I've never been a very good teacher, but I'm constantly having to explain things that I'm just learning to others who have a similar level of understanding as well.</p>
				<p>After reviewing my feedback, I felt pretty good for the most part. While there were definitely some areas of improvement, pretty much all of the feedback was generally positive and others have enjoyed working with me and benefitted from me. There were a few from early on which I recognized some of my short comings and have already begun improving on. The biggest thing I need to work on is slowing it down a little bit. I can tend to work quickly and not always formulate my thoughts before saying something and this can negatively impact my pair. While this was something that I was somewhat aware of, it has been really great hearing others perspectives, although we would all like to have flawless feedback. Writing feedback was always interesting because sometimes when you're reflecting you notice things that during the pairing session you might not have identified as problems. More often then not, I've had some really good pairing sessions and writing actionable feedback is often the most difficult element of this for me.</p>

				<h2>Tech Industry Issue</h2>
				<h4>11/2/2014</h4>
				<p>One of the biggest issues facing the tech industry is economic in nature. The issue is that a lot of the consumer spending on tehnology tends to be use of descretionary funds. Due to this, tech companies can take a significant impact when economies are tight. Specifically, before the great recession of 2008, the consumer savings rate was -1%. While clearly unsustainable, the consumer savings rate is now 4%. The change is understandable, but savings makes up a portion of descretionary income. As such, this indicated that people are spending less on technology than they were prior to 2008. The good news is that there are many tech companies, such as Google, who make their money in other ways, such as through ads. Personally, while I think ads are a good monetization method, I feel there is definitely a need for a change to profit from a high volume of users without imparing the experience by inindating them with ads. I don't know what the next best monetization method is, but I know I'll certainly be on the look out as well as thinking of different things to implement (and hopefully patent/license).</p>

				<h2>Thinking Style</h2>
				<h4>10/26/2014</h4>
				<p>My learning style is concrete random. After doing some research and some self thought. After this, I've determined that working on challenges alone and being able to try and experiement with different things, specifically. Also diving into the material is almost always more beneficial than simiply learning the theory for me. Despite this, it's definitely still important for me to get the theory base, like reading the book. Finally, I need to be aware of this and possibly keep this to a minimum during pairing. My trial and error based approach often leads me to take over as a driver and get internally frustrated (slightly and I do a good job of expressing it in a conductive manner) when navigating because I want to see if something work or not.</p>
				<p>At this point in Phase 0, my biggest struggle as been with CSS on the conceptual level. This definitely is due to the way that I think. Ironically, this has beeb frustrating because it involves a lot of guess and check. Part of the frustration is that I learn through guess and check method, but there is a lot of doing it even after I've already learned and somewhat know what I'm doing in CSS. Also as noted another struggle has been with pairing, but I'm definitely aware of it and working on it.</p>
				<p>The biggest thing I need to change about the way that I learn is partially the aspect that drives me. Competition drives me to do better even if it is not explicit competition. I'm constantly guaging myself versus others and strive to do better. This is very indicative to a fixed mind set and includes risk aversion, at least on a public level. While I'm ok with failing in my own tickering by myself, I don't like to fail on a public stage and have the perception that I'm not intellegent. As you can clearly tell, this definitely needs to change.</p>
