				<h2>Enumerable Methods</h2>
				<h4>11/2/2014</h4>
				<p>In ruby, there's a really useful set of tools called enumerable methods. The reason they're so helpful is that they help you operate on an array or a hash to do a sequence on each of the items in the object it's called on. As such, the rubist must realize that an enumerable is more or less an extension of the each method, with specific purposes. Specifically one of my favorite enumerable methods is map. What map allows the rubist to do is the supply a block of code and manipulate the the contents of the object and then return a new array based on what was mapped. For instance using a map with a block saying to multiply the item by itself might look like this:</p>
				<p><span class="code">(1..4).map { |x| x * x }</span></p>
				<p>And the output of this method would be:</p>
				<p><span class="code">[1, 4, 9, 16]</span></p>
				<p>As you can see, our method called the contents of 1 through 4 to individually multiply by themselves. Therefore the array output gave us the squared value of each of each number 1 through 4. Pretty cool, huh? I think so and as you might imagine this type of method could be very useful when coding.</p>

				<h2>Arrays & Hashes</h2>
				<h4>10/26/2014</h4>
				<p>In ruby, arrays and hashes have a lot of similarities, but ultimately differnt in purpose and use. The similarities are that both arelists of information, which are known as objects. Both can hold any kind of object, although with arrays the key is an integer as opposed to hashes which can use any object as a key.  The latter could particularly useful when you need to have a username/password stored and the password is the key for the username (which we can view as the door that you want to enter to access you computer, account, etc.). Another big difference is that becuase of this distinction, arrays have a natural order and hashes do not. The last and biggest distinction between the two is that hashes are more flexible and easier to use, but arrays have almost twice as many methods that can be called on them (read: more things you can do with them). So the trade off with hashes vs. arrays ulimately becomes that of code efficiency with hashes, but greater effectiveness with arrays. It is important to note that this pretty broad generalization and is may not be exact for everything you're trying to accomplish in ruby, but usually hases = flexible and arrays = usable.</p>

				<h2>CSS Design</h2>
				<h4>10/22/2014</h4>
				<p>So I decided to do some research to flesh out exactly what the difference is between 3 aspects of an element in an HTML page. Each element is really made up of 4 parts. Those parts are the content, padding, border, and margin. The content is what I'm referring to when I say the element. This is of course the text, table, or whatever is actually occuring on the page. So the content and the border are pretty easily defined, but the margin and the padding are a little bit more ambiguous. As you can see in the picutre below, the padding is the space between the content and border. From there the margin is the space between the border and other elements or the edge of the page. This is all pretty simple, right? Well yes, but not every element has to have a border. ...so what happens with our margin. Well, it can still be there, but in this case the padding and the border are essentially the same thing. You can still include both, but they're effectively serving as a buffer between the other elements on the pages and the content. Additionally, you can make a transparent border and make it very thick to serve as a buffer between the content and other elements on the page, effectivelly creating a makeshift margin (but why would you). So really, there are three seperators between the content and everything else. The padding is simply the first seperator, the border is the second seperator (which is generally visible), and the margin is the last one. We just happen to name each of them based on a logical flow and what they should look like, but beyond that there's a relative degree of interchangability.</p>
