				<h2>JavaScript<h2>
				<h4>11/23/2014</h4>
				<p>This week I spent learning JavaScript. There's definitely still plenty to learn though, but it was a lot different this time around. Since I had spent extensive time learning Ruby prior to starting phase 0, picking up Ruby was a lot easier due to the prior experience with it, although I still did a lot of learning in the past 4 weeks. On the other hand, with JavaScript, Ruby was my only applicable prior experience so getting used to the new syntax has been a little bit challenging. All in all, I think the best thing for me to do in addition to the challenges that I will complete, going through the JavaScript courses on code academy will be beneficial as this really helped me develop the a solid base for the Ruby skills that I now have (limited as they may be). One notable similarity between Ruby and JavaScript are Ruby's Hashes and JavaScripts Objects. They are both denoted by curly braces and contain items with a key:value relationship. The biggest difference is that Objects in JavaScript can be nested, which seems to allow for a lot more flexibility. Also, keys that are listed in JS objects can be called like a method that will return the value stored in that key. All in all, the languages definitely have some similarities, but I think due to the fact that these are the only two programming languages that I have experience with, they feel quite a bit different.</p>

				<h2>OOP Concepts</h2>
				<h4>11/21/2014</h4>
				<p>I've been spending a lot time working through Ruby and more recently working through JavaScript, both of with are object oriented langauges. While this is knowledge is really valuable, I realized that I don't know much about functional programming, which is considered to be the opposite of object oriented programming. The first thing that I learned about functional programming is that it is generally considered to be more difficult than object oriented programming, but they benefit the coder in that they provide a higher efficiency and integrity. Also they work well with networked computers running functions on various CPUs. Another benefit is that programs can be broken down into smaller, simpler pieces that the user can use for more reliable programming and are generally easier to understand. But, beyond the why, what exactly is functional programming. Ultimately, function programming broken down into two main parts. The first is that data is immutable or unchanging. This means that instead of changing something like a variable when you need to update it, you would instead create a new variable based on the original one and use this new vairable from here on out (until of course you need to change that variable and the cycle repeats). The other main aspect of functional programming is that they are stateless. This really just means that every function operates independently of what happened elsewhere in the program. In practical terms, this means that functions only use data that is passed as an argument, rather than taking data from values that are outside of the function. While this is really just the tip of the iceberg (as you might have imagined), this is essentially what functional programming is. We can clearly see how this differs from object oriented programming as functions do not operate in a vacuum, as they do with functional programming, and we obviously make updates to variables, arrays, hashes, etc. as this is a base functionality and is heavily used in object oriented programming. From this, is easier to understand how they are different and are consider to be opposites.</p>

				<h2>Ruby Classes</h2>
				<h4>11/9/2014</h4>
				<p>Classes are really important part of Ruby coding. Classes allow you to create methods that can be called on a specific class. We can equate this to things in the real world. Let's say that you're a chef and you come up with a new type of dish, we'll call it YBUR. Now you YBUR has a set of ingredients that don't really change, but you can do a lot of different cooking based things to them. As such, you make a list of how to prepare the ingridents. Similarly in Ruby, we create classes and methods that apply to those classes. These methods won't work on any other objects except ones that are of an applicable class. Going beyond this, there's a really important concep called instances inside of clases. Instances are a form of variable, method, etc. that can be called on beyond the class or method that it's created in. To denote this for variables, we use the @ symbol. This allows us to use the variable stored here in a specific method, outside of that method. This functionality of Ruby gives is a large amount of flexbility and really gives the language a lot of dynamics.</p>

				<h2>Enumerable Methods</h2>
				<h4>11/2/2014</h4>
				<p>In ruby, there's a really useful set of tools called enumerable methods. The reason they're so helpful is that they help you operate on an array or a hash to do a sequence on each of the items in the object it's called on. As such, the rubist must realize that an enumerable is more or less an extension of the each method, with specific purposes. Specifically one of my favorite enumerable methods is map. What map allows the rubist to do is the supply a block of code and manipulate the the contents of the object and then return a new array based on what was mapped. For instance using a map with a block saying to multiply the item by itself might look like this:</p>
				<p><span class="code">(1..4).map { |x| x * x }</span></p>
				<p>And the output of this method would be:</p>
				<p><span class="code">[1, 4, 9, 16]</span></p>
				<p>As you can see, our method called the contents of 1 through 4 to individually multiply by themselves. Therefore the array output gave us the squared value of each of each number 1 through 4. Pretty cool, huh? I think so and as you might imagine this type of method could be very useful when coding.</p>

				<h2>Arrays & Hashes</h2>
				<h4>10/26/2014</h4>
				<p>In ruby, arrays and hashes have a lot of similarities, but ultimately differnt in purpose and use. The similarities are that both arelists of information, which are known as objects. Both can hold any kind of object, although with arrays the key is an integer as opposed to hashes which can use any object as a key.  The latter could particularly useful when you need to have a username/password stored and the password is the key for the username (which we can view as the door that you want to enter to access you computer, account, etc.). Another big difference is that becuase of this distinction, arrays have a natural order and hashes do not. The last and biggest distinction between the two is that hashes are more flexible and easier to use, but arrays have almost twice as many methods that can be called on them (read: more things you can do with them). So the trade off with hashes vs. arrays ulimately becomes that of code efficiency with hashes, but greater effectiveness with arrays. It is important to note that this pretty broad generalization and is may not be exact for everything you're trying to accomplish in ruby, but usually hases = flexible and arrays = usable.</p>

				<h2>CSS Design</h2>
				<h4>10/22/2014</h4>
				<p>So I decided to do some research to flesh out exactly what the difference is between 3 aspects of an element in an HTML page. Each element is really made up of 4 parts. Those parts are the content, padding, border, and margin. The content is what I'm referring to when I say the element. This is of course the text, table, or whatever is actually occuring on the page. So the content and the border are pretty easily defined, but the margin and the padding are a little bit more ambiguous. As you can see in the picutre below, the padding is the space between the content and border. From there the margin is the space between the border and other elements or the edge of the page. This is all pretty simple, right? Well yes, but not every element has to have a border. ...so what happens with our margin. Well, it can still be there, but in this case the padding and the border are essentially the same thing. You can still include both, but they're effectively serving as a buffer between the other elements on the pages and the content. Additionally, you can make a transparent border and make it very thick to serve as a buffer between the content and other elements on the page, effectivelly creating a makeshift margin (but why would you). So really, there are three seperators between the content and everything else. The padding is simply the first seperator, the border is the second seperator (which is generally visible), and the margin is the last one. We just happen to name each of them based on a logical flow and what they should look like, but beyond that there's a relative degree of interchangability.</p>
