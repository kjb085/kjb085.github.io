Post: Recursion is a pretty common item in computer science. This is when a function calls itself as part of the function. This of course COULD create an infinite loop and crash your computer. For this reason, all methods that are recursive need to have some sort of an escape. For example a method that takes the factorial of an argument given the condition that the argument is greater than 1, but when it calls itself, the method must modify the argument such that it will eventually reach 1 and therefore break the cycle. This of course can be done by passing the initial argument minus 1 to the point where the recursive method calls itself. While this is just one example, the ultimate idea is that recursive methods must modify the argument when calling itself again and have multiple branches where a newly passed argument will eventually end up at and break the loop.
