Post: In ruby, arrays and hashes have a lot of similarities, but ultimately differnt in purpose and use. The similarities are that both arelists of information, which are known as objects. Both can hold any kind of object, although with arrays the key is an integer as opposed to hashes which can use any object as a key.  The latter could particularly useful when you need to have a username/password stored and the password is the key for the username (which we can view as the door that you want to enter to access you computer, account, etc.). Another big difference is that becuase of this distinction, arrays have a natural order and hashes do not. The last and biggest distinction between the two is that hashes are more flexible and easier to use, but arrays have almost twice as many methods that can be called on them (read: more things you can do with them). So the trade off with hashes vs. arrays ulimately becomes that of code efficiency with hashes, but greater effectiveness with arrays. It is important to note that this pretty broad generalization and is may not be exact for everything you're trying to accomplish in ruby, but usually hases = flexible and arrays = usable.
