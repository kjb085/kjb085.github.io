Post: This week I spent learning JavaScript. There's definitely still plenty to learn though, but it was a lot different this time around. Since I had spent extensive time learning Ruby prior to starting phase 0, picking up Ruby was a lot easier due to the prior experience with it, although I still did a lot of learning in the past 4 weeks. On the other hand, with JavaScript, Ruby was my only applicable prior experience so getting used to the new syntax has been a little bit challenging. All in all, I think the best thing for me to do in addition to the challenges that I will complete, going through the JavaScript courses on code academy will be beneficial as this really helped me develop the a solid base for the Ruby skills that I now have (limited as they may be). One notable similarity between Ruby and JavaScript are Ruby's Hashes and JavaScripts Objects. They are both denoted by curly braces and contain items with a key:value relationship. The biggest difference is that Objects in JavaScript can be nested, which seems to allow for a lot more flexibility. Also, keys that are listed in JS objects can be called like a method that will return the value stored in that key. All in all, the languages definitely have some similarities, but I think due to the fact that these are the only two programming languages that I have experience with, they feel quite a bit different.
