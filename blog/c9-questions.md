Post: Asking good question is a very important topic. There are several specific aspects of asking good questions. The first is how you explain the problem. You can pose the question in a simple form, but expounding upon the problem is critical to the communication of your question to the person or persons who will answer it. This not only helps those who answering the question, but it allows it to be more engaging. Another key aspect of asknig good questions is to be able to not only explain the question, but to be able to repreat your problem and show others how to repeat it. This is important as others who might not know the answer to your question to be able to research and try it out. All in all, these are only two important aspects of the many to asking good questions (and therefore important to get good answers), which are specifically revolving around the art of coding.
